# Non-recursive depth first search

Given a list of all edges of a graph with vertices 1 to n, this algorithm will explore every vertex, depth first.
Useful when a large graph is to be explored, as the recursion limit on python is not a problem.
When exploring a smaller graph, consider using recursive dfs.

Warning: the order in which vertices are explored is not lexicographic
